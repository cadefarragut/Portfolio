			<h3>Systems Software Engineer - <i>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</i></h3> <p>June 2025 - Now</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: ' ' ">
				<li>I develop and maintain firmware for HPE iLO, a dedicated management interface that operates independently of the server's primary hardware and operating system, 
					enabling full remote administration at all times. Our team manages bugs and tasks through the JIRA ticketing system and uses active sprints to track progress and meet deadlines. 
					I work closely with hardware and software engineering teams to identify root causes and implement solutions through hands-on debugging, testing, and validation. </li>

			<h3>Software Engineer Intern - <i>Hewlett Packard Enterprise</i></h3> <p>Summer 2024</p>
			<ul style="list-style-type: ' ' ">
				<li>I developed a Python script in Eclipse that integrated Postman APIs and Redfish to automate server testing for HPE's iLO chip. 
					I was responsible for running daily test passes, diagnosing failures, and identifying bugs in recent code merges. 
					At the end of my 12-week internship, I presented my work at the HPE intern project fair.

				<li>I ran daily tests on HPE's ROM chip, which stores the BIOS on Synergy server blades, and diagnosed bugs that prevented the servers from booting into the OS. 
					I validated recent code merges before firmware updates were released to customers, ensuring proper boot functionality across Windows, Linux (Red Hat and SUSE), and VMware ESXi.
